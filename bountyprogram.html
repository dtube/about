                        the chance that we might have missed one posing a significant vulnerability. If you discover a bug,
                        we appreciate your cooperation in responsibly investigating and reporting it to us so that we can
                        address it as soon as possible. For significant bugs, we offer reward and recognition on our Wall
                        of Fame (below).

                    Responsible investigation and reporting includes, but isn't limited to, the following:
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Don't violate the privacy of other users, destroy data, disrupt our services, etc.</li>
                    <li>Only target your own accounts in the process of investigating the bug. Don't target, attempt to access,
                        or otherwise disrupt the accounts of other users.</li>
                    <li>Don't target our physical security measures, or attempt to use social engineering, spam, distributed
                        denial of service (DDOS) attacks, etc.</li>
                    <li>Initially report the bug only to us and not to anyone else.</li>
                    <li>Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the bug before disclosing it to anyone else, and give us adequate
                        written warning before disclosing it to anyone else.</li>
                        <p></p>In general, please investigate and report bugs in a way that makes a reasonable, good faith effort not
                        to be disruptive or harmful to us or our users. Otherwise your actions might be interpreted as an
                        attack rather than an effort to be helpful.

                    Generally speaking, any bug that poses a significant vulnerability, either to the security of our site
                        or the integrity of our trading system, could be eligible for reward. But it's entirely at our discretion
                        to decide whether a bug is significant enough to be eligible for reward. Security issues that typically
                        would be eligible (though not necessarily in all cases) include: <p></p>
